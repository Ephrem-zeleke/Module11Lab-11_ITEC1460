Project plan for personal finance tracking
Personal finance tracking
Project description 
Tracking a personal finance is a challenging for me and for many others and it is good to have a permanent solution to have a healthy financial situation in our life. the personal finance tracking database is the solution to solve this problem. The project proposes a relational database system that centralizes and organize all financial activities like income, expenses, budgets, and goals into normalized tables. This project will provide a scalable, query able structure to automate tracking our personal finance activities and support us on decision-making regarding our personal financial situation. 
Types of data to track
•	User profile 
•	Financial accounts
•	Income and expense transaction
•	Spending categories
•	Monthly budgets by category
•	Recurring income and expenses
•	Financial goals and saving progress
•	User profile and currency preference 
Database administration concerns 
the project will address a database administration concerns like scalability, high availability, and security concerns by taking different measures. 
Scalability 
The database will be designed to implement normalization up to second normal form (2NF), ensuring minimal redundancy and easy expansion. Indexing key columns and optimizing queries will support performance as the dataset grows. 
High availability
To ensure high availability, the database can be hosted on a managed cloud-based service with automated backups and multizone replication. Local backups and failover strategies will be put in place for recovery in case of outages. 
Security requirements
One of the main concerns for database is a security and the project will address security issue by implementing the following mechanisms
•	Using role-based access control to restrict sensitive data access
•	Encrypting data at rest and in transit 
•	Storing credentials and sensitive configurations securely
•	Implementing input validation and protection against SQL injection for any connected frond-end.
